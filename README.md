A guide on how to make NVIDIA vGPU [v15.4](https://docs.nvidia.com/vgpu/15.0/) work on Ubuntu 22.04

## Summary
1) Check the support matrix and see what works best for you. For me it was this version: [v15.4](https://docs.nvidia.com/vgpu/15.0/product-support-matrix/index.html#abstract__ubuntu)
2) If you are still testing or trying things out, you can setup an Enterprise Account that will give you a [FREE 90-day evaluation license](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/resources/vgpu-evaluation/)
## First things first!!
Before even getting started, figure out what version of NVIDIA vGPU do you need. There is a [Support Matrix](https://docs.nvidia.com/vgpu/15.0/product-support-matrix/index.html#abstract__ubuntu) page detailing what your Host OS needs to be, and which VM OS(s) are supported. This will be important later

## Setup Enterprise account (**Free** 90-day eval license)
